"Race Master" is car game application where players navigate a road with three lanes, each filled with fast-moving green cars headed towards a red car. It's a single-player game that challenges your agility. The goal is to avoid collisions for as long as possible to rack up the highest score.
Instructions: 
Upon starting the game, you'll see a road with three lanes. Your red car will be positioned in one of these lanes.

The objective is to prevent the red car from colliding with the green cars moving towards it. Swipe left or right to steer the red car and avoid the oncoming green cars.
Each time a green car passes the red car without collision, a point is added to your total score. Keep track of your score as you play.
With every 10 seconds of gameplay, the speed of the green cars increases by one. This adds to the challenge, requiring quicker reflexes.
Race Master stores the highest, second highest, and third highest scores achieved by the player. Try to beat your own records and climb up the leaderboard.
The game ends when the red car collides with any of the green cars. Upon termination, the final score is displayed on the screen.
If you'd like to play again, simply restart the game and strive to achieve a higher score.
Race Master is all about quick reflexes, strategic maneuvering, and aiming for a high score.
